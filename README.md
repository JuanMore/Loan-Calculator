# Loan-Calculator
This is a Loan Calculator that determines your monthly, total and interest payment. It saves user data to local storage and utilizes bootstrap for UI as well as a loading circle and error messages. I had fun building this as it was something I created by applying what I've learned. I like working with Javascript and figuring out all the things I can do with it!
